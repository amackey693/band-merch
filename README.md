#### Author: **Ryan Duff & Allison Mackey, June 30, 2020**

### Description

_This application serves as an introduction to React with create-react-app, components, JSX, and props while building a static site. The band merch site hosts an inventory of merchandise related to the band, tshirts, cd's etc and allows a user to look at the inventory. Buying an item decreases the inventory for any given item. Users may also add items to the inventory.
